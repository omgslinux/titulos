A Symfony project created on September 24, 2016, 12:10 pm.

    The project is intended to organize, classify and collect the necessary information so the Grupo de Titulizaciones de la Coordinadora de Vivienda de Madrid can perform all kind of investigation to help stop evictions, based on the idea that the bank sold the mortgage debt to a so-called Securities Fund. The reason for the bank to manage this structure is to avoid any unpayment risk during the time the loan lasts. Also, the banks need fresh money to carry out their daily business, and they can't wait for decades to get the money back (even with huge profits). So, they get these funds to take these risks.

Easy, isn't it? Not that easy...

Maybe if there were no evictions, this could be overlooked, but evictions break rights, and there is an average of hundreds of evictions per day (and still go on), so people can't stand still about this. So, investigating deep on the "market mess", it was impossible for everything to be democratic and according to the law. That's it. If a banks performs operations to get rid of the unpayment risk, and there's an eviction, the bank can't start a lawsuit process because the moment the bank created the fund with the loans for somebody else to take the risk instead (in exchange of a big amount of money, of course), because the bank isn't the owner of the debt anymore as a consequence of the previous sale.

The fund itself doesn't have the legal capability to perform any lawsuit action, by law requirements, so when the unpayments take place for any reason, it should be fund itself who should start the trial process as the real debt owner. This trivial issue forbids (theorically) the bank to carry out any trial process against whoever stops paying for whatever reason, because the bank doesn't have the legitimate right to sue for a debt which isn't owned by the bank itself, but somebody else (the fund). And since the fund, in one hand, isn't intended to do anything else than collecting profits, and the legal status doesn't allow to initiate any process by itself, the usual behaviour is to rely on the bank to do the job, as long as this can be achieved.

Since this fact against the law has been discovered, there has been an ongoing work focused on creating documentation to be used as a pattern, so people in an eviction process can use and at least delay, or even win the process. There are over 20 success cases where eviction have been stopped with strategy.

But for that, people need a tool where they can look for their loan in the many existing funds, so they can take that fact to the judge and prove the real situation (which usually the banks denies and tries to hide). So, we're trying to collect the whole set of loan lists for all funds, and dump them into a database. This way, we expect that at least most entities whose funds are published in a digitalizable way, can be into this database, where the search just takes a few seconds. Meanwhile, non-digitalizable lists have to be physically read line-by-line with magnifying glasses or similar "tools" to try to find the loan, relying on our own eyes for this task.

So, we have to collect and classify the funds, together with their legal documents, to have a smart framework where people willing to help in any task, can at least find efficient and properly organized information that prevents them lots of headaches when investigating about stuff related to the funds and loans.
